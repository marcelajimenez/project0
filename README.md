This project creates a small website for the small company in my city "Griinpack".
It contains stuff like clients, what they do, contact information, some pictures, table, among others.
The SCSS file has a SCSS variable, nesting and inheritance. As well as one mobile response @media. Also it includes a SCSS inheritance using @extend for the messages. And a SCSS nesting for the font in div and p.
File index.html contains one Boostrap column, and you can find another one in file index_2.html.
